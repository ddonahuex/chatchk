# chatchk
Chatchk provides example source code demonstrating how to interact with
Open WebUI and Ollama API endpoints within a Nethopper Private AI
instance.

By default, it sends a "Why is the sky blue?" prompt to both Open WebUI
and Ollama APIs, using the gemma2:9b model, which is pre-installed in a
Nethopper Private AI instance.

This project is written in Go (version 1.24).
